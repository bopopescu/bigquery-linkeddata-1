[BigQuery](https://code.google.com/apis/bigquery/) is a large-scale, interactive query environment that can handle billions of records in seconds. This project provides support to use [Linked Open Data](http://lod-cloud.net/) in BigQuery with the goal to interactively query the entire LOD cloud (currently some 25 billion records).

If you want to try it out, simply [checkout](http://code.google.com/p/bigquery-linkeddata/source/checkout) the code and follow the steps described in the [README.txt](http://bigquery-linkeddata.googlecode.com/hg/README.txt) file.

You can have a look at an early version of the [BigQuery Endpoint](http://bqs-endpoint.appspot.com/), a Google App Engine application, or check out the [slides](https://docs.google.com/present/view?id=dg6w6n8g_36hqx8gvdh) explaining how to use it:
